Your text is well written, it includes all required ingredients, images have captions, the timeline is exhaustive, and of course the project is great. If you wish to improve it in view of the submission in January, my suggestion would be to more the research question at the beginning rather than the end. **Always put your name along with your student number** (you are the author of this!) and expand your references. ICMC and NIME are annual conferences publishing relevant proceedings; you could also use Google Scholar and the library to search for additional sources. 

Lastly, if on the one hand you connect your discourse precisely to the technical motivations of your choice in terms of technique, you don’t seem to provide the reader enough information about the aesthetic implications of your design: can you start imagining how that will be?  Perhaps you already know what you are aiming, can you describe it? What artistic musical projects inspired you? You can pick from the fields of music computing, machine learning, computational art, software art and media art. This could enrich your work. Also, there are theorist and musicians describing the aesthetics and poetics of making sound/sound instruments, is there anyone resonating in particular with your project?
