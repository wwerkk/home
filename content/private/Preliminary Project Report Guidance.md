For the Preliminary Project Report, you should identify and scope out a viable research project which centres around your own research interests within the subject areas of music computing.

You are required to thoroughly research a problem area and to communicate that information with intended solutions to an audience in a manner that reflects practices and standards found in industry. Keep in mind that the focus should not just be on the intended outcome but should also significantly detail the the process is the project.

The report should include an in-depth analytical study on your chosen subject area. It should include a detailed timeline with key milestones for the completion of the project. It should also include a proof-of-concept (with some reflection) as a way of evidencing progress to date and viability of project.

## Structure
The report should be **2000 words**. Ideally, the report can be a draft for the first part of the final project report. [Have a look at the structure here.](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1028619) The first three sections can be outlined in the report:

1.  Project overview (~300 words)
	A succinct description of your project at the start of your report. Make sure your project has a title. Try to answer the questions ‘What is it?’ ‘Why is it?’ and ‘How is it?’ before going on to describe the project in more detail.
2.  Background research (~1000 words)
	Place your project in context by making reference to existing materials. Depending on your project, these could be software, products, research papers, artworks, artists, specific techniques, or blogs. Make sure to explain the significance of each to your chosen project. Make sure you reference these using Harvard style referencing.
3.  Context, users/audience, (~700 words)
	Describe the context of your work (i.e. where does it take place, or where will it be used? Relate the context to its participants or audience by describing whom your project is aimed at:
	-   For projects that are primarily experienced by someone (for example, a performance), describe the intended effect on your audience. You should can compare that to some of the key inspirations from your background research section.
	-   For projects that are primarily intended to be used by someone or something (for example a plugin, instrument, or, app), describe the types of uses and the (testable) goals for its usage
As mentioned above, the report should include a detailed plan taking you from this point to the final submission date. Include as many milestones as possible. Where you have libraries/platforms to research include links.

#### Your report should aim to convince the reader that:

-   this is a viable project
-   your project is informed and supported by relevant scholarly material
-   you have considered all the components of the project (research, technical, practical, etc.)
-   you are knowledgeable on the subject and equipped to undertake the project

#### The following learning outcomes will be assessed:

-   Assess and select from the relevant literature, and to critically engage and contribute to ongoing research and production in your field.
-   Analyse and contextualise the student’s own creative and technical style and process
-   Develop an individual critical perspective on music computing research and production
