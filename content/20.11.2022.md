*Welcome.*
*Hopefully looking at me working with an open door will prove to be interesting enough.*

Over the past year I have been quite invested in the latest advances of the field of so called [[neural audio]], which belongs somewhere between  [[machine learning]] and [[data signal processing]]. Partially because of the buzzword quality of it and the way I tend to guide my interests sometimes (ie. going for the [[hype]] and verifying whether it is actually something relevant to my subjective experiences).

The second year of the [[EMCT]] saw me taking up the second part of the [[Sound and Signal]] module, a [[Python]] endeavour which threw me into the world of [DSP](data signal processing) *proper*, [[audio feature extraction]], [[librosa]], and other things alike.
Something something...
